#import arc.py and associated pacakges
#it needs to be initialized
#I will need a table to base the repetition off of
  #This table needs to have something that can be used as a name
#This requires a mapdocument to already exist
  #Make sure that the mapdocument beginning nad it's source isn't too long as arc.py does not like long file names
#I'll need some sort of for or while loop to cycle through the table
  #It will need to pan to (given a particular map document)
  #then save that with a new extension
#Keep doing that until there is nothing left in the table
#Annouce that you have finished
