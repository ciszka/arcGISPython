# Name:        MakeMapDocs
# Purpose:  The goal of this program is to take a list of sites; or places; from
#           a list and use that to iterate through and make map documents of
#           each item that is in that list preserving items like the Key etc

#Open a Map document
#This wants to be a tool within ArcGIS where possible so I need to set it up
#As a toolbox
#I want a particular map document to be opened and set up
#I want then to make copies of that map document
#But each map document is zoomed in at a particular distance for each site
#In the Table
